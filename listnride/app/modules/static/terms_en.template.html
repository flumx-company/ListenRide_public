        <p>1.2</p>
        <p>Agreements made between listnride and the user shall be based exclusively on the present Terms of Use as well as confirmation of user agreement pursuant to 3.1.3. General terms and conditions of business of the user shall not apply, even if listnride does not expressly contest their inclusion. The language of the agreement shall be German.</p>
        <p>1.3 </p>
        <p>Some provisions of the Terms of Use shall only apply to the user if they are a consumer within the meaning of Section 13 of the German Civil Code (BGB – Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) or an entrepreneur within the meaning of Section 14 BGB. </p>
        <p>1.3.1</p>
        <p>A consumer is a user who is using the services of listnride for a purpose that cannot be attributed to either their trade or their independent professional activities.</p>
        <p>1.3.2</p>

        <p> The Terms of Use may be displayed and saved as a PDF file. Users are also entitled to a printout.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subhead">§ 2 Communication Platform</h3>
        <p>2.1</p><p> listnride operates a platform on the Website (hereinafter “Platform”) via which individuals or legal entities (hereinafter “Users”) can rent out (referred to hereinafter in this capacity as “Party Renting Out”) or rent (referred to hereinafter in this capacity as “Renter”) bicycles and other sport and leisure equipment (hereinafter “Used Items”). </p>
        <p>2.2</p><p> listnride itself is neither the owner nor the holder of such Used Items, neither does it rent them out. listnride merely arranges conclusion of the agreement and in this process is authorized as a representative to conclude agreements on behalf of the Party Renting Out.</p>
        <p>2.3</p><p> listnride does not provide the internet access or other technical services required for use of the Platform.</p>
        <p>2.4</p><p> listnride continuously works to optimize and expand the services offered via the Website. This may lead to changes, particularly to the technical requirements for providing and transmitting advertisements and booking inquiries.</p>
        <p>2.5</p><p> listnride may have the services to be performed via the Platform fully or partially carried out by subcontractors at any time. Any subcontractors engaged shall be bound by contract to adhere to listnride’s data protection regulations and to observe confidentiality.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subhead">§ 3 Registration; Concluding a User Agreement </h3>
        <p>3.1</p><p>Parties Renting Out and Renters (hereinafter jointly referred to as “Users”) may only use the Platform after first having registered on the Website. Upon registration an agreement concerning the use of the Platform (hereinafter “User Agreement”) is concluded between listnride and the Users.</p>
        <p>3.1.1</p><p>In order to register, it is necessary to provide mandatory information, which is requested during registration (hereinafter “Master Data”). The User affirms that the Master Data are correct, up to date and complete and that the data they are providing do not injure the rights of third parties (e.g. rights to use names or trademarks). The User shall inform listnride immediately of any changes to the Master Data. </p>
        <p>3.1.2</p><p>The User only makes a binding offer to conclude a User Agreement by clicking on the “Register Now” button. By doing so they also confirm the Terms of Use. Prior to this, the Master Data are displayed to the User in an overview. The User can correct the information provided and subsequently amend it in their user account at any time using the change buttons.</p>
        <p>3.1.3</p><p>Once registration is complete, listnride sends the User an e-mail confirming the registration (hereinafter “Confirmation of User Agreement”). The User is required to verify the e-mail address they provided via a link. Upon verification registration is complete and a User Agreement is concluded between the User and listnride. listnride now creates a personal account for the User (hereinafter “User Account”) and activates it.</p>
        <p>3.1.4</p><p>listnride shall store the Confirmation of User Agreement and the User can no longer view or retrieve it on the Website.</p>
        <p>3.2</p><p>The Master Data are stored in the User Account. Other Users can only view them when and to the extent necessary for making contact. listnride shall use the Master Data exclusively for the purpose of executing and processing the User Agreement. listnride shall also evaluate the Master Data in anonymized form for statistical and empirical purposes.</p>
        <p>3.3</p><p>Only individuals, legal entities and partnerships with unrestricted legal capability are permitted to register. Legal entities and partnerships may only be registered by an individual authorized to represent them, who must be specified by name. During registration, only individual persons may be named as holders of membership accounts (i.e. not married couples or families). Multiple registrations under different member names are not permitted.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subhead">§ 4 Right of Revocation</h3>
        <p>A User who is a consumer is entitled to revoke their declaration of willingness to enter into an agreement. It is noted here that information on the conditions for exercising the revocation and the legal consequences thereof can be found in the separate Revocation Instruction.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subhead">§ 5 Term; Termination</h3>
        <p>5.1</p><p>The User Agreement is concluded for an indefinite period.</p>
        <p>5.2</p><p>Unless otherwise agreed, the User may terminate the User Agreement at any time without the requirement to observe a notice period. The agreement must be terminated in text form. For example, Users may terminate the agreement by e-mail to contact@listnride.com. Rental Agreements that have already been proven or arranged shall remain unaffected by the termination. This shall also apply accordingly to claims to payment of the listnride fee (see § 15 below) that are already due.</p>
        <p>5.3</p><p>Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, listnride may terminate the User Agreement at any time giving two weeks’ notice. The right to terminate for good cause shall remain unaffected. In particular, good cause shall be deemed to exist if: </p>
        <p>5.3.1</p><p>the User fails to meet a not merely insubstantial payment obligation in full or in part despite a reminder;</p>
        <p>5.3.2</p><p>the User breaches their duties under these Terms of Use and does not take corrective action despite a reminder. A reminder shall not be required if it does not hold out any promise of success or if the breach is so severe that it is unreasonable to expect listnride to adhere to the agreement. The severity of the breach may also be based on the User already having been warned repeatedly on account of a comparable breach;</p>
        <p>5.3.3</p><p>listnride can no longer offer the Platform in its previous form due to a change in the legal situation or case law or a judicial or official order;</p>
        <p>5.3.4</p><p>listnride discontinues the Platform or its business activities; or</p>
        <p>5.3.5</p><p>the opening of insolvency proceedings against the User’s assets is rejected for lack of assets.</p>
        <p>5.4</p><p>After the agreement has ended, the User shall no longer have access to the membership account or profile of the Party Renting Out. listnride shall not be responsible for safeguarding the information stored in the membership account and profile of the Party Renting Out. The User is thus required to back up the data relevant to them on a storage medium independent of listnride in good time prior to the end of the agreement.</p>

        <h3 class="md-subhead">§ 6 Use of the Platform</h3>
        <p>6.1</p><p>The User undertakes not to use the Platform in an improper manner. In particular, they are not permitted to:</p>

        <p>6.1.4</p><p>block, overwrite, or amend content from listnride; or</p>
        <p>6.1.5</p><p>use the Platform using a system or program that impairs the security, integrity and/or availability of the systems employed by listnride to operate the Platform, cause robots or automated processes to influence the Platform or enable such influence, or otherwise disrupt the proper and smooth functioning of the Platform or access the Platform without authorization.</p>
        <p>6.2</p><p>The User shall indemnify listnride against all claims asserted against listnride by third parties due to improper use within the meaning of § 6.1. They shall compensate listnride for any losses incurred by listnride as a result of such improper use, including any legal costs. The User shall support listnride in its legal defense.</p>

        <p>7.2</p><p>The User is required to protect computers and other data carriers on which login data and passwords are stored or used.</p>
        <p>7.3</p><p>The User shall be liable for all damage brought about by any third-party use for which they are responsible. </p>
        <p>7.4</p><p>If the User breaches the duties of care specified in 7.1 and 7.2 to a significant degree, listnride shall be authorized to block the User’s access to their membership account (temporarily). The User shall be informed of this by e-mail.</p>
